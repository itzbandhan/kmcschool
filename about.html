            For KMC, every child is special and has unique ability. Our approach
            is to respect the diversity and reach to each child for nurturing
            his/her to grow.

          <li style="text-align: justify">
            School should become data driven adopting best practices; hence we
            have to consider KMC as the learning institution.&nbsp; It always
            goes for innovative ways to enhance capacity and skills of students
            and connect their learning to real life context.

            Teaching-learning at KMC is student-centered, focusing on hands-on
            activities for learning through experiences and guide them to
            construct their won understanding. The instructional activities also
            engage students up to critical and creative thinking.
          </li>
          <li style="text-align: justify">
            School is a place that provides foundation for “lifelong learning’,
            which is possible only if both, teachers and students work together
            in respectful, noble, and caring atmosphere. Students need to have
            freedom to express their feelings and share their creativities.
          </li>

            Parent’s support and collaboration is important for creating
            positive learning environment for children.
